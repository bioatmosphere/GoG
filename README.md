**A conceptual framework for Demography-based Integrative Modelling of Ecosystems and the Biosphere.**

Theoretical and empirical research have established a view of ecosystems and the biosphere as complex adaptive systems since the early 1990s. After half of a century of effort in modelling ecosystems and the biosphere interacting with the atmosphere, a premise remains of up-scaling biogeochemical processes without appreciating their complexity to capture self-organization and emergence. However, this prevailing and fundamental assumption, however feasible and impactful, is losing its grounds as anthropogenic disturbances facing ecosystems and the biosphere become more frequent and intense. We argue that the time comes of formulating a real integrative ecosystem model that can transcend boundaries of scale and organism (especially plant and microbe, two major branches of the tree of life), explain their high-dimensional interactions with the environment, and ideally march together with empirical research. Here, we propose a framework of Pattern, Diversity, and Process (PDP) for demography-based integrative modelling of ecosystems and the biosphere to contribute to this grand goal.
